## How to use TestCube?

### 1. Generate XUnit Results

To get started with TestCube, your automation tests should at least meet one requirement:

- Must generate **xunit** test results.
- Xunit report reference: http://reflex.gforge.inria.fr/xunit.html#xunitReport

**xunit** is a standard output of unit tests, it can be produced by almost all kinds of test frameworks, also  it can be easily imported by varies of tool, for example: Jenkins, TeamCity etc.

So you probably don't have to change anything in your current test project, just add arguments to generate **xunit** results. 

### 2. Upload via TestCube Client

To talk to TestCube server, you should have TestCube client installed.

```
pip install testcube-client
```

Then you can choose any strategy to talk to TestCube.

#### 2.1 Upload xunit result to TestCube once test finished.

```
testcube-client --xunit "/path/to/xunit*.xml --server "http://server:port"
```

#### 2.2 Create and complete run separately.

Before run started

```
testcube-client --start_run --run_name "Run Name" --tags "smoke,core"
```

After run finished

```

```

### 3. Review Reports and Analyze Test Run

Once results had been uploaded, you should be able to view test reports from home page.
